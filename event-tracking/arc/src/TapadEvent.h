// Tapad Events are used for tracking significant application occurrences that
// will be sent to Tapad for possible ad targeting.  They are not related in any
// way to iOS events such as touch and accelerometer events, but they can be 
// created and sent from code that handles them, if appropriate for targeting. 

// They are designed to be generic, i.e. there are no specific event types per 
// se.  The one exception is the application installation event, which is
// handled by the tapad library in a special way.   

// To send an event to tapad, it's best to use one of the class methods, which 
// construct and transmit the events for you.  In special cases, you may want
// to instantiate a TapadEvent object, and then send them to Tapad later. 

// Behind the scenes, Tapad takes your event, and schedules it for transmission
// in the background, using the iOS Grand Central Dispath API, with a queue name
// distinct to tapad.  This means you can send an event at any time in your 
// code, including during the main run loop.  The call will return immediately,
// and the event will be sent at some point later in the execution of the app. 

// Events are not guaranteed to arrive at Tapad, and have delivery timeouts.
