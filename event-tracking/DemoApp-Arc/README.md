# Tapad iOS Event Tracking API Demo App
This application exercises the full range of identifiers collectable by the SDK. [MyEnabledTapadIdentifiers.h](MyEnabledTapadIdentifiers.h) enables all of the pre-complier flags. [DemoAppAppDelegate.m](Classes/DemoAppAppDelegate.m) demonstrate the enabling and disabling of each via config. Please note that if you choose to not enable the pre-compiler flag for a given identifier, the config method for the identifier will not be available (i.e. XCode will warn you that the method is not available).

## iOS 6 Advertising Identifier
iOS 6 introduced -[ASIdentifierManager advertisingIdentifier] which is now supported by this SDK. The SDK respects the user's intent by first checking -[ASIdentifierManager isAdvertisingTrackingEnabled].  Please run this application with iOS 6 simulator as well as iOS 4 or 5 simulators to see the difference in behavior when the API is not available.
